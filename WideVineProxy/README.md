    Console application: WideVineProxy project overview
========================================================================

The Application Wizard has created this WideVineProxy application for you.

This file outlines the contents of each file that makes up the WideVineProxy application.


WideVineProxy.vcxproj
    This is the main project file of the VC++ project generated using the application wizard, which contains the version information of the Visual C++ that generated the file, as well as information about the platform, configuration, and project features selected using the application wizard.

WideVineProxy.vcxproj.filters
    This is a VC++ project filter file generated using "Application Wizard". It contains information about the association between the project file and the filter. In the IDE, through this association, files with similar extensions are displayed in groups under a specific node. For example, ".cpp" files are associated with the "source files" filter.

WideVineProxy.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

    These files are used to generate a precompiled header (PCH) file named WideVineProxy.pch and a precompiled type file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

The application wizard uses the "TODO:" comment to indicate which part of the source code should be added or customized.
